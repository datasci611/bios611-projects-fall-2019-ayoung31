Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?

Not quite yet.

Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?

Yes.

Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?

Yes.

Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?

Yes. If you are mostly interested in comparing groups (i.e. Veteran/Not veteran),
maybe consider plotting the proportion/percentages instead of the counts.

How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?

You could use some comments in your python notebook and your Rmd files.

Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?

Yes

Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?

Yes. Maybe add some text about how knowing the characteristics of the clients will help UM better serve them.
Knowing that there are more veterans than non-veterans, what should they consider doing different with their services?

Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).

Yes

Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?

Report needs more interpretation of what the figures mean to UM.

Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?

Purpose is there, need more analysis.

Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?

Could use more to your conclusion to communicate overall messages.
