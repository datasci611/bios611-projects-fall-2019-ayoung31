##feedback from ajLuna7 on project 3

## Overall feedback:
--Nice work! The project looks really good as a first draft. See below for additional comments and ways to make analysis and concepts clearer. 

Provide feedback about the following topics:
1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
--Not yet.

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
--Yes, Python and R are used for wrangling and visualization, respectively. 

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
--Not yet.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
--Yes, the plots are very visually appealing and organized very well. Nice work! 

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
--The project is very interesting. One question that comes to mind is about the "Reason for Leaving" graph. I wonder what "Other" could mean. How will that determine how you analyze "program success", as you mention in your conclusion. Also, why do you think might only be staying for only a month? What explanations might you suggest? Might be interesting to speculate a little in the conclusion about this. 

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
--Yes, very clearly. Nice work. 

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
--Yes, the final report is organized well. No code is left in the final report, graphs are clearly explained, and there is a clear organization. This is suitable for a general audience, and appropriate for non-programmers to understand. Nice work! 

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
--Yes, a link is provided. 

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
--Yes, graphs are clear, colorful, and concise. 

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
--Not really. What is the main question you are trying to answer? Is it: "How successful is the program?" If so, what defines success? Explain how you are connecting your analysis to the main question. How will this analysis help UMD make decisions? 

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
--For the most part, yes. The project indicates there is more to take care of, and it seems like the author is aware of what they need to do to tie everything together. Overall, very nice work!!
