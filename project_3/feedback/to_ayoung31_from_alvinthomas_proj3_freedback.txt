To ayoung31:

Thank you for your feedback. I appreciate the time you spent reviewing my work.
As you note, some of the technical details of my project were not complete
at the draft stage, but I was able to fully implement Docker and Make in the
final version. Thank you for encouraging me to think about the conclusions that
could be made from my project. I have tried to add some more interpretation to my
report.
